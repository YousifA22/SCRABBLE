Welcome to GUI Scrabble!


Rules of GUI scrabble:

The first thing that will pop up is a GUI asking the user how many AI players they want to play with.

The second panel asks if you would like a default board, or a custom board.

The GUI will then display the the board of buttons(15x15) and the current users Info, all the user has to do is click on one of the buttons at the bottom (in hand)
then click on the board where you want to place.

Note: The first word needs to be placed in the center

If the first word is placed and it is not in the center a pop up will appear saying you need to place it in the center.

Once a word has been placed from the user the Submit button needs to be pressed and will verify that the word that the user placed is in the dictionary

If the word is not in the dictionary a Pop up error will come up saying that it is not a valid word 

If the current player can't make a word they can use the button on the board named "Skip" which will change the turn to the next player.

If the current player wants to get a new hand, they can use the button "Draw" and it will replace every tile in the hand, You may only draw onceper round.

The dictionary will be searched for valid words and The dictionary we are using can be found at https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000

Once the current user selects the Submit button and it is verified the turn will change and the AI will play a word of its choice from its own Hand 

The current players Hand will then be updated with new tiles (ReAdded)

Once the AI plays the user will be able to see the result on the board and in the words created field, then the user can play again to try and create a word.

The words that are darkened out are the letters the user placed.

There are 4 special type of tiles: double word, Double letter, Triple word, Triple letter, each colours are identified on the left side of the gui.

In the middle of the default board is a double word tile!

													
												Have Fun!

Notes:


In order to use a custom board, you must alter the premiumsquares.xml file in order to customize your board. (an example is already within the premiumsqaures.xml file)
